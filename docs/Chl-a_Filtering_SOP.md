# Chlorophyll-*a* Filtering SOP
*Last updated 27 Apr. 2019 by MEL*

**1.** **TURN OFF THE LIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  
This is critical. Samples will be useless if you leave the lights on.


**2.** Place a GF-C filter for each sample + 1 extra **on the “dirty” filter manifold.  
Be sure you are using GF-C filters – you CANNOT use POC filters or sed trap filters for chl-a samples!**

**3.** **Record the sample information for each bottle on the chl-a filtering log.**  
If it has been more than 24 hours since the sample was collected, please note this in the *Notes* column.

**4.**	Be sure the manifold is connected to the filtrate flask and vacuum pump, and that the filter columns you are using are open.

**5.**	Shake the 2L sample bottle until the sample is homogenized. Pour a select amount into a graduated cylinder and then into one of the filter columns. **Rinse the cylinder between sample bottles.**   

a.	One of the 2L bottles of sample should have two reps, and it doesn’t matter which one – in fact, it’s better to mix it up and choose a different depth each time. All of the other samples can have one rep each. 

b.	We want enough sample on the filter to be measurable, but not so much that the filter is totally clogged and takes forever to filter through. **There should be substantial, opaque color on the filter; if not, you need to filter more volume.** The amount of sample you need to filter will decrease as algal biomass increases through the summer. A good estimate is that the BVR cyano bloom samples will require ~300 mL, while low-biomass samples in the spring will require ~800-1000 mL for filtering.

**6.**	**Record the volume of water filtered for each sample.** 

**7.**	Turn on the filter manifold. If there are a lot of particulates in the water it may take some time to vacuum pump the water through, so now might be a nice time to have a snack, check email, etc. HOWEVER, you will likely need to pour out the filtrate from the vacuum flask several times before all the samples have been filtered **to avoid sucking water through the vacuum, so pay attention to that!**

**8.**	Once the sample has finished filtering, close the filter column.

**9.**	Using tweezers, fold the filter like a burrito (trifold) and wrap it in aluminum foil.

**10.**	Label the aluminum foil package using the notation:

> `RES DDMonYY chl-a Xm`  

Where:  

* RES = FCR or BVR  
* DDMonYY is the date the sample was collected, i.e. 27APR19  
* X is the depth at which the sample was collected  

**11.**	Rinse the filter column with DI water and start filtering another sample, or just rinse the column with DI water if you don’t have any more samples to filter. Rinse the filtrate flask when you are all done.

**12.**	Place the aluminum-wrapped, labeled samples in the small freezer box of the fridge in 2025. There should be a Tupperware labeled **CHLA 2019** – please put the samples in there.
