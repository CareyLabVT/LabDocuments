# Shipping Flora for Maintenance SOP
*Last updated 8 Feb. 2018 by MEL*

### BEFORE THE DAY OF SHIPPING:  

**1.**	Contact Cayelan and Bobbie to let them know that Flora needs to be sent off (explain why) to get permission for funds to allocate towards shipping and calibration. At this time, you can ask Cayelan for a fund # to use for shipping and calibration costs.  

**2.**	Contact Tim Doyle at PP Systems (<td@ppsystems.com>; 978-834-0505). You’ll be shipping to them first and they will then ship to bbe-moldaenke in Germany. Tim will send you a service return form and case #. You’ll need these before shipping.   

**3.**	If you haven’t already, contact bbe (<bbe@bbe-moldaenke.de>) to let them know you are shipping the probe to PP systems (can cc them on email to Tim).  

**4.**	Go dumpster-diving for an appropriate-sized box. No guarantees you’ll find one on the first try, so I’d work ahead on this task. There are cardboard recycling dumpsters at either end of Derring.  

**5.**	Ditto to find packing material as needed.  

### ON DAY OF SHIPPING: 

**1.**	Arrange with Biological Sciences office to have FedEx pick up your package that afternoon. Best to do this first thing in the morning, if not the afternoon before. You can either:  

*   **a.** Ask the office to print a shipping label for you; if you do this, you’ll need the following information ready:  

    -   Account # (the office can tell you this; it’s the department account)
    -   What kind of shipping you want to do (overnight, 2-day, etc….we use standard rate)
    -   Weight of Flora + box (there is a scale in Derring 1082 in a gray carrying case, but she’s about 35 lbs.)
    -   Dimensions of cardboard box (length, width, height)
    -   Special services? Yes, direct signature required
    -   Declared value? We usually do $100 (gross underestimate)
    -   Fund number (should have already gotten this from Cayelan)   

*   **b.** Fill out a paper one (get from the FedEx supplies box in the 1st floor lobby on the far side of the building)

**2.**	Clean fluoroprobe.

**3.**	Make sure probe and case are both labeled so we get them back! Ditto with any accessories you send. Labeling tape works well for this.

**4.**	Disconnect Flora from casting rope and put her in field carrying case along with the required accessories (usually power/computer connection cable, autostart plug, and workstation cover).

**5.**	Fill out the service return form from PP systems. Make a copy to send with Flora, and then scan a copy to send to Tim and to keep for your own records. Put the service return form in the carrying case with Flora.

**6.**	Pack Flora into cardboard box with packing materials and seal.

**7.**	Attach shipping label to cardboard box.

**8.**	Drop Flora off in the Biological Sciences office in the Package Room (behind desk in main office area).

**9.**	Email Tim, Cayelan, and Bobbie to let them know Flora is boxed, when she is being picked up, and when she should arrive to PP systems.
