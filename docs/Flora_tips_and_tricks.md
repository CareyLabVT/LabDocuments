## THOUGHTS ON SAMPLING WITH FLORA
[fill this in]
1. mooring
2. benchtop work
3. recreating proprietary algorithm (PLSR)
4. comparing to other sensors (EXO chla is primarily green algae; might be worth comparing cyanos to EXO phycocyanin)
5. always going to measure higher than everything else because she is summing across multiple pigments whereas all our other sensors just detect one
