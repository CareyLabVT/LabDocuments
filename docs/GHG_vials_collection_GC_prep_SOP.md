# DISSOLVED GREENHOUSE GAS FIELD COLLECTION AND GC PREPARATION
*Last updated 10 May. 2019 by RPM*

**FIELD COLLECTION OF WATER SAMPLES FOR GC ANALYSES**
**1.** Collect the water samples directly into empty, uncapped serum vials.  Gently fill the vial without turbulence.  **(Use the same techniques you would for a Winkler.)** Fill the gap in the rubber septum cap as well.  Make sure there are no bubbles remaining in the vial, then push the septa onto the vial.  Turn the vial over and look for bubbles.  If you see any, dump the sample and try again.  Collect replicates from each depth. **Be sure to continually apply pressure to the rubber septum cap and the glass vial. If pressure is not continuously applied then bubbles will form between the metal part of the cap and rubber septum and then that bubble will be forced into the vial when you crimp**   

**2.** Crimp the caps onto the vials. Place the crimp directly on top of the cap and vial and **GENTLY** clamp the crimper until the cap is tightly attached to the vail. ** NOTE - If crimped too tightly the glass vial will blow out of the bottom and the sample will be lost.**

**3.** Record the vial number in the field notebook and then place it on ice in the cooler. 

**4.** Back at the lab PLEASE PLACE THE VIALS INTO A TUPPERWARE IN A FRIDGE AND NOT A FREEZER. 

**PREPARING HEADSPACE IN WATER SAMPLES**
**1.** Move helium into the gas bag:  Make sure the UHP helium tank is open, but the propeller valve on the regulator is set to deliver nothing.  Connect the rubber tubing on the stem valve of the gas bag to the tank of UHP helium.  Open the stem valve by rotating counterclockwise.  Loosen the screw cap with septa on the gas bag.  Adjust the UHP helium tank regulator to the lowest delivery pressure that is detectable.  Fill the bag ~2/3rds full then push down gently and lift the threaded cap to push the bag flat.  Repeat 5 times.  Then screw the threaded cap down.  Fill ~2/3rds full again.  Turn the tank off.  Close the stem valve by rotating clockwise.  Disconnect the tubing.

**2.** Record analysis room temperature and barometric pressure at beginning and end and at least every 4 hours   

**3.** Find a 3-ml syringe with a 1-way stopcock and a 22 to 26 gauge needle.  Helium moved from cylinder to a gas bag will insure that the helium is at atmospheric pressure when sampled. Insert the needle into the septum of the gas bag.  Withdraw 2 ml from the gas bag.  Close the stopcock. Withdraw the needle.

**4.** Insert a second 3-ml syringe with a 22 to 26 gauge needle (no stopcock needed) in one side of the septum.  Keep the end of the needle close to the septum.  (We want the helium to be injected above this needle).

**5.** Holding the serum vial with the septum facing downwards, insert the needle of the syringe with helium deeper than the first needle (further upwards), open the stopcock and inject the helium.  Do not release pressure off the plunger or water will backflow into the gas syringe!  When all the gas has been delivered, pull the needle out of the septum.  Try not to push sideways against the septum.  That opens the vial to the atmosphere.

**6.** As you inject the helium, water will be pushed into the other syringe.  It should be about 2 mls, but temperature differences affect gas pressures and could make it less.  Make it exactly 2 ml by drawing the plunger back to 2 ml.  Pull the needle out of the septum.

**7.** Warm the samples to room temperature.

**8.** Put vials in a container ** UPSIDE DOWN** and then trsnport to the third floor analytical lab for RPM or BRN to run on the GC.
