# Aim
The aim of this document is to outline expectations for authorship on lab products (e.g., presentations, publications, EDI data products, etc.). Our goal is to be inclusive of all potential collaborators who have provided meaningful contributions, without whom the final product would not have been possible. We encourage product leads to discuss authorship early in the evolution of a project and continue to check in about authorship at project milestones (e.g., at the transition from data collection to analysis to writing). We strongly encourage the project lead and coauthors to work together to document their contributions – both at the initiation of and throughout a research activity that is expected to result in a product – in a formal authorship contribution statement. We hope this document will inspire discussion among coauthors throughout the project.

##*What merits coauthorship?*

We think that there are multiple ways in which a collaborator can make meaningful contributions, which may include (but are not limited to!)

* Project development
* Project infrastructure/funding support
* Data collection
* Laboratory analysis/sample processing
* Data/statistical analysis
* Developing figures
* Model/module generation
* Model calibration
* Data interpretation
* Writing

We do not necessarily consider data collection or lab analysis of samples to warrant coauthorship per se, without additional meaningful intellectual contribution to the overall project. For example, we do not consider the collection of field data or analysis of laboratory data by paid undergraduate assistants or research technicians to warrant coauthorship unless **independent** intellectual contributions are provided above and beyond the work they are being compensated for financially or with course credit. These intellectual contributions could include: e.g., developing new data collection protocols, initiating independent exploratory data analysis, creating new figures, writing new code, etc. 


##*Undergraduate student/Research technician coauthorship*
We realize that knowing what constitutes a meaningful contribution for coauthorship is challenging and may vary among projects/labs, so we encourage undergraduate assistants and research technicians to discuss these issues with their lab mentors at the beginning and throughout their time in the lab. Because many undergraduates may not know that authorship on a peer-reviewed product is a possibility or what the expectations for authorship may entail, it is especially important for their lab mentor and CCC to help guide those conversations as appropriate given the level of work that the student is completing in the lab. For example, the goal of conducting an undergraduate thesis in the lab is a publishable manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal, so it is important for thesis students and their lab mentor(s) to have ongoing discussions about manuscript development and authorship. 

In the case of undergraduate theses, the independent research contribution that is required to complete a thesis inherently merits coauthorship on products resulting from that work. In some cases, it may be appropriate for the lab mentor to be lead or corresponding author on a product after the undergraduate graduates, depending on the situation. Conversely, it is usually more challenging to identify if other research assistant activities in the lab (e.g., sample prep, data analysis) merit coauthorship. As noted above, we do not consider the collection or analysis of field and laboratory data by paid undergraduate assistants or research technicians to warrant coauthorship unless independent intellectual contributions are provided above and beyond the tasks they are assigned as part of their basic job description or course requirements. 

One important ethical requirement for being a coauthor is being able to describe and defend the research that went into the project. Consequently, we expect that any coauthor will remain engaged and contribute to the project until the product is completed. Most projects take multiple years to complete from data collection to publication in a peer-reviewed journal. As a result, authorship on intermediary products (e.g., oral presentations or posters at a conference) does not necessarily equate to coauthorship on final products (e.g., peer-reviewed publications). After an undergraduate student or technician leaves the lab, we expect that they will be responsive on email and provide up-to-date contact information to the primary author for projects that they are contributing to, as well as make sure that all data sheets, notebooks, files, etc. are digitized and properly archived with their lab mentor and CCC. A former student or technician must stay in contact with the lab post-graduation to be considered a coauthor on ongoing projects because they need to be able to sign off on their name listed on any manuscript. Thus, if a student loses contact with the lab, it is not ethically appropriate to list them as a coauthor.

##*Graduate student/Postdoc coauthorship*
We operate with the philosophy that lab members will provide general feedback on writing and talks, occasionally assist with field/lab work, etc. without the explicit expectation of authorship. Our philosophy is to be inclusive of authors and encourage graduate students and postdocs to talk with lab members early in the development of dissertation chapters and side projects about authorship. We encourage lab members to be reflective of their contributions and opt-in to being a coauthor on research products only when they realistically feel that they can make meaningful contributions. If a coauthor feels during a project that their contributions no longer merit coauthorship, we encourage them to initiate a conversation with the project lead about their status as a coauthor.
	
For graduate students and postdocs leading a project, it is important to reach out to coauthors early in the development of a product and initiate authorship discussions throughout the project’s evolution. As part of those conversations, we encourage graduate students and postdocs to acknowledge potential coauthors’ contributions to date as well as identify what explicit expectations need to be met for future coauthorship (e.g., substantive feedback on different aspects of the project, writing a specific section of a manuscript, etc.) which would be articulated in an authorship statement to accompany a manuscript. 

Far in advance of when a student/postdoc leaves the lab (e.g., multiple months beforehand), they need to meet with CCC to develop a plan for archiving datasets, code, samples, models, etc. they worked on as well as a plan for authorship/coauthorship on lab projects. The general expectation is that all lab datasets and their metadata will be archived and published via EDI, all shared project code archived on the lab github, any physical samples are quantified and properly archived (with a plan for how and when they will be disposed), and an up-to-date copy of all files affiliated with a product will be made available before a student/postdoc leaves (e.g., manuscript drafts, figures, and the code/data to reproduce any analyses/visualizations). At the time of leaving the lab, the student/postdoc and CCC will make an explicit plan for how to finish any ongoing lab projects. In the event a student is no longer willing or able to lead a lab product (e.g., moves onto a position where they are unable or do not want to lead a project to completion, is non-responsive to email for multiple weeks without providing any contact info), then CCC will become the default corresponding author to ensure that the lab product is completed. The overarching goal of this process is to ensure as smooth of a transition as possible and minimize the burden for current and future lab members, as well as future you! 

##*EDI data products*
Publishing data products is a new practice for most scientists. Our lab expectation is that most of the data we collect will be archived with metadata and standard formatting within a year of collection; this is now a requirement by the National Science Foundation and is a best practice for reproducible, open science. We recognize that there are many contributions to the collection, analysis, QA/QC, collation, and archiving of datasets. Similar to the description of what merits coauthorship on manuscripts, our philosophy is that coauthorship on data products requires independent, intellectual contributions to the dataset. These substantive contributions may include (but are not limited to!): development of data collection protocols/methods, development of QA/QC code, development of new laboratory analysis methods, and collation of data for the generation of metadata. 

Except in cases where a dataset is produced solely as part of a graduate student/postdoc project separate from the lab’s core monitoring program, the expectation is that CCC will be the lead and corresponding author to ensure the long-term maintenance, continuity, and integrity of EDI data products over time. We expect the author list of the lab’s reservoir monitoring EDI data products will grow as datasets are appended to over time because to be a coauthor that contributed to e.g., one year of a multi-year dataset, still represents a substantial contribution to the overall dataset. 
Because the practice of data publishing is rapidly evolving, we anticipate the need to revisit and revise this section periodically.
