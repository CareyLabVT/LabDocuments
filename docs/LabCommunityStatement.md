# Reservoir Group Community Statement

We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience to everyone. This statement was developed with the goal of affirming our group’s commitment to everyone’s personal and scientific growth and development. This is a living document that we will revisit and update annually at the beginning of the fall semester.

Safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by both 1) day-to-day interactions we all have with each other and 2) ensuring that our commitment to these principles is embedded in the group’s longer-term strategic decisions. It is the responsibility of all members of our group to work together to create and maintain a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment for all.

## Action Plan

We are actively working to promote a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment in our group, our communities, and our disciplines by:

* Holding each other accountable to a group code of conduct: we co-created the Reservoir Group code (updated by the group annually) to ensure everyone has a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience in our community

* Leading regular conversations: we have time dedicated at the beginning of each weekly Reservoir Group meeting to discuss these topics and resources, and at least one full meeting per semester focused on promoting a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience for all

* Developing safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free frameworks for: our community interactions (via our code of conduct); recruiting and mentoring students; and safely conducting fieldwork

* Conducting translational science: we work closely with managers and community members to co-develop scientific studies and conduct research to ensure that our findings are usable and accessible to the communities we live and work in

* Communicating our science: we partner with educators, outreach coordinators, and managers to translate our research, solicit feedback, and ensure that our findings are broadly shared and accessible to the public

* Promoting innovative practices of open science: to enable greater participation in freshwater science, we use and develop open-source software, publish all of our data shortly after collection, and are constantly evolving our practices to ensure accessibility and reproducibility of our data and analyses

* Creating educational modules: we develop, assess, and disseminate hands-on, active learning teaching materials to enhance STEM education. We use assessment data to constantly revise our teaching modules and methods to improve their accessibility for a wide range of students
