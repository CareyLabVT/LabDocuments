# Reservoir Group Inclusion and Diversity Statement

We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience to everyone. This statement was developed with the goal of affirming our shared values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility and is grounded in our group’s commitment to everyone’s personal and scientific growth and development. This is a living document that we will revisit and update annually at the beginning of the fall semester.

Safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by both 1) day-to-day interactions we all have with each other and 2) ensuring that DEI is embedded in the group’s longer-term strategic decisions. It is the responsibility of all members of our group to work together to create and maintain a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment for all.

## Action Plan

We are actively working to promote greater inclusivity in our group, our communities, and our disciplines by:

* Holding each other accountable to a group code of conduct: we co-created the Reservoir Group code (updated by the group annually) to ensure everyone has a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience in our community

* Leading regular conversations on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility topics: we have time dedicated at the beginning of each weekly Reservoir Group meeting to discuss these topics and resources, and at least one full meeting per semester focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or accessibility 

* Developing anti-racist frameworks for: our community interactions (via our code of conduct); recruiting and mentoring students; and safely conducting fieldwork

* Conducting translational science: we work closely with managers and community members to co-develop scientific studies and conduct research to ensure that our findings are usable and accessible to the communities we live and work in

* Communicating our science: we partner with educators, outreach coordinators, and managers to translate our research, solicit feedback, and ensure that our findings are broadly shared and accessible to the public

* Promoting innovative practices of open science: to enable greater participation in freshwater science, we use and develop open-source software, publish all of our data shortly after collection, and are constantly evolving our practices to ensure accessibility and reproducibility of our data and analyses

* Creating educational modules: we develop, assess, and disseminate hands-on, active learning teaching materials, which reduce the achievement gap of students in STEM. We use assessment data to constantly revise our teaching modules and methods to improve their accessibility for a wide range of students
