# Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) Filtering SOP
*Last updated 27 Apr. 2019 by MEL*

**1.** Pre-weigh 4  filters using the balance on the granite block. (use 47 mm **COMBUSTED** GF/F filters; 0.7 μm). If there are pre-weighed 47 mm GF/F filters in manila envelopes, you can use those. **Be sure you are using the correct filters – you CANNOT use sed trap filters or chl-*a* filters for POC samples!**   
***If we are out or almost out of combusted filters, please tell a grad student.***


**2.** **Record the weight of each filter on the filtering log.**

**3.** Put each filter on a filter column, **using the “clean” filter manifold. IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU USE THE CLEAN FILTER MANIFOLD TO AVOID SAMPLE CONTAMINATION.** Be sure the manifold is connected to the filtrate flask and vacuum pump, and that the filter columns are open.

**4.**	**Record the sample information on the filtering log in the row corresponding to the filter you are using for that sample.**

**5.**	Shake the 2L sample bottle until the sample is homogenized. Pour a select amount into a graduated cylinder and then into a filter column. **Rinse the cylinder between sample bottles.**   

a.	Each 2L bottle of sample should have two reps, (i.e. one 2L bottle --> pre-weighed filters 1 & 2, second 2L bottle --> pre-weighed filter 3 & 4, and so on).  

b.	One of the 2L bottles of sample should have two reps, and it doesn’t matter which one – in fact, it’s better to mix it up and choose a different depth each time. All of the other samples can have one rep each.  

c. We want enough sample on the filter to be measurable, but not so much that the filter is totally clogged and takes forever to filter through. **There should be substantial, opaque color on the filter; if not, you need to filter more volume.** 

**6.**	**Record the volume of water filtered for each rep.** 

**7.**	Turn on the filter manifold. If there are a lot of particulates in the water it may take some time to vacuum pump the water through, so now might be a nice time to have a snack, check email, etc. HOWEVER, you will likely need to pour out the filtrate from the vacuum flask several times before all the samples have been filtered **to avoid sucking water through the vacuum, so pay attention to that!**

**8.**	Once the sample has finished filtering, close the filter column.

**9.**	Using tweezers, fold the filter like a burrito (trifold) and wrap it in aluminum foil.

**10.**	Label the aluminum foil package using the notation:

> `RES DDMonYY POC Xm`  

Where:  

* RES = FCR or BVR  
* DDMonYY is the date the sample was collected, i.e. 27APR19  
* X is the depth at which the sample was collected  

**11.**	Rinse the filter column with DI water. When you are all done, rinse the filtrate flask and acid-wash the filter columns in the acid bath in 2029. You can leave them to dry on the drying rack next to the left-hand sink as you walk in the door of 2025.

**12.**	Place the aluminum-wrapped, labeled samples in the small freezer box of the fridge in 2025. There should be a Tupperware labeled **POC 2019** – please put the samples in there
