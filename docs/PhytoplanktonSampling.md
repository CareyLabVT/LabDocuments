# Phytoplankton sampling SOP
*Last updated 11 Sep 25 by MEL*

### Before fieldwork

#### *Prepare a sample bottle*

**1.** Locate a brown 250 mL polypropylene bottle in 2029. The bottle should be completely opaque - we do not want light penetrating the bottle!

**2.** Use the 1 mL plastic pipets in the acid cabinet in 2025 to add 2.5 mL of Lugol's solution to the bottle. Wear gloves and be careful! It is not good to get Lugol's solution on your skin. You are adding 2.5 mL because to preserve the phytoplankton, we need to have a 1% concentration of Lugol's after the sample is added to the bottle, and the bottle is 250 mL (1% of 250 mL is 2.5 mL).

**3.**	Add a piece of label tape to the bottle. If you know what depth you will be sampling from, label the bottle following the Carey Lab sample label nomenclature:

**Example:**
F25JUL25P1.6 mean you sampled at Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) on July 25, 2025 at a depth of 1.6 m

If you don't know what depth you will be sampling from (for example, if you are sampling from the depth of chlorophyll maximum, which you won't know until you get out in the field), you can still label the bottle but just leave the depth to be filled in by the field crew.

**Example:**
F25JUL25P_____

**4.**	Place the bottle in the appropriate field cooler.

**5.**	Make sure you have an extra prepped bottle just in case something crazy happens - maybe there will be a huge bloom on when you arrive at the reservoir and you will want to take an extra sample!

**6.**	If you are planning to sample the depth of chlorophyll maximum, make sure that the FluoroProbe is also packed and ready to go, as you will use it to determine the chlorophyll maximum depth.

### In the field

#### *Take a phytoplankton sample*

**1.** If you are sampling from the chlorophyll maximum depth, refer to the [Flora_Cheatsheet.md](https://github.com/CareyLabVT/LabDocuments/blob/master/docs/Flora_Cheatsheet.md) for instructions on how to use the FluoroProbe to find the chlorophyll maximum depth.

**2.** If the depth is not already labeled on the sample bottle, use a Sharpie to add it to the label BEFORE you fill the bottle with water. It is a lot easier to label a dry bottle than a wet bottle.

**3.** Use the Van Dorn to collect water from the depth you wish to sample. 

**4.** Stabilize the Van Dorn so you do not have to hold it and the phytoplankton bottle simultaneously. This is a safety precaution - remember, Lugol's solution is toxic!

**5.** Open the Van Dorn and dispense water into the sample bottle until it is full. It is ok if the bottle is not 100% full, but try to get it as full as possible. It is better to have the bottle a little under-full than to splash Lugol's on yourself or into the reservoir when it overflows.

**6.** Recap the bottle **tightly** and replace it in the sample cooler. The bottle does NOT have to be kept cold so if space in the cooler is limited, it can be stored and transported outside the cooler.

### After fieldwork

#### *Store the sample*

**1.** Phytoplankton samples are stored on the shelves on the far right hand wall in 2025 as you walk into the room. There will be a lot of other 250 mL brown polypropylene bottles there so it should be easy to spot. If you can, try to store the samples in chronological order - that is, find the most recent sample bottle and put your sample bottle next to that one.

**2.** Approximately once a year, sample bottle lids need to be tightened to prevent evaporation and degradation of the samples.

**3.** Samples preserved with Lugol's can be kept for a few years but do degrade over time. Samples kept much longer than 4-5 years are likely to be quite degraded and difficult to count.
