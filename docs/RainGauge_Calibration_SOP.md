# Rain Gauge Field Calibration SOP
*Last updated 11 Jul. 2016 by MEL*

### Principles/Background:  

We have a TE525 Tipping Bucket Rain Gage.  Rain falls into a circular funnel of known area.  The funnel leads to a two-bucket lever on a pendulum below the funnel.  When an amount of rain that is equivalent to 0.01 inches of rain over the entire area of the funnel top has entered the tipping bucket, the water is tipped out and a voltage signal is sent to the computer.  Thus, the amount of rainfall in a set time interval can be calculated by counting the number of tips over that time interval.  As a reference, 0.01 in. of rain is approximately equivalent to 0.25 mm of rain.  

To calibrate, we want to ensure that the bucket is actually tipping when the correct volume of water has entered the bucket.  To do this, we must calculate the water volume which is equivalent to 0.01 inches of rainfall across the area of the funnel top.  For our gage, this volume is approximately 8.25 mL.  We will verify that the tipping bucket responds when 8.25 mL of water enters the bucket, and if not we will adjust the gauge accordingly.

### Materials: 

-	Pipets (theoretically any type works but field crew suggestion is to go with mechanical pipets)
-	Cup to hold water
-	Hex keys
-	Materials to clean out rain gauge as necessary

### Procedure:  

**1.** Lift the funnel and filter off the rain gauge.  Make sure the funnel, the filter, and the inside of the rain gauge are clean and no debris is preventing rain from entering the tipping bucket.

**2.** Pipet 8.25 mL of water into the tipping bucket to see if it tips at the right volume.  PIPET SLOWLY AND GENTLY TO AVOID EARLY TIPPAGE DUE TO EXCESSIVE WATER PRESSURE.  Think of a “drip, drip, drip” technique.

**3.** IF IT TIPS TOO EARLY: Adjusting screws are located on the bottom adjacent to the large center drain hole.  Adjust both screws the same number of terms.  Rotation counter clockwise increases the water volume required before tipping.  One half turn of both screws causes a 2-3% change.

**4.** IF IT TIPS TOO LATE: Adjusting screws are located on the bottom adjacent to the large center drain hole.  Adjust both screws the same number of terms.  Rotation clockwise decreases the water volume required before tipping.  One half turn of both screws causes a 2-3% change.

**NOTE:** It may be difficult to get to 8.25 mL exactly because the bucket becomes very sensitive as it approaches 8 mL.  Do not be discouraged.  Just do your best!  

> Repeat steps 2-4 as needed until the tipping bucket is responsive at 8.25 mL.  Replace the funnel and filter.  

If factory calibration is required, we’ll need to contact Campbell Scientific.
