# Sediment Trap Filtering SOP
*Last updated 27 Apr. 2019 by MEL*

**1.** Pre-weigh 8 filters using the balance on the granite block. (use Whatman 934-AH filters; 1.5 μm). If there are pre-weighed 934-AH filters in manila envelopes, you can use those. **Be sure you are using the correct type of filter – you CANNOT use POC filters or chl-*a* filters for sed trap samples!**


**2.** **Record the weight of each filter on the filtering log.**

**3.** Place each filter in an aluminum weigh pan.

**4.** Label the aluminum petri dish using the notation:

> `Sed_Xm_Rn_Fm_DDMonYY`  

Where:  

* *X* = 8 or 4 (depending on depth of trap deployment)
* *n* = cylinder rep number (1-2)
* *m* = filter number (1-8)
* the date the Sed Trap was collected is recorded as DD is day of month 01-31, Mon is first 3 letters of month (Jun, Jul, etc.), YY is year (17, 18).

**5.** **Record the sample information on the filtering log in the row corresponding to each filter.**

**6.** Put each filter on a filter column, **using the “dirty” filter manifold**. Be sure the manifold is connected to the filtrate flask and vacuum pump, and that the filter columns are open.

**7.** Shake the 2L sample bottle until the sample is homogenized. Pour a select amount into a graduated cylinder and then into a filter column. **Rinse the cylinder between sample bottles.**

a.	Each 2L bottle of sample should have two reps, (i.e. one 2L bottle --> pre-weighed filters 1 & 2, second 2L bottle --> pre-weighed filter 3 & 4, and so on).   

b.	We want enough sample on the filter to be measurable, but not so much that the filter is totally clogged and takes forever to filter through. A good estimate is that you will need ~100 mL sample for 8m traps and ~200mL for 4m traps during the summer stratified period.  

**8.**	**Record the volume of water filtered for each rep.** 

**9.**	Turn on the filter manifold. If there are a lot of particulates in the water it may take some time for all eight filters to vacuum pump the water through, so **now is good time to have snack, grab a coffee, or check your email.** HOWEVER, you will likely need to pour out the filtrate from the vacuum flask at least once before all the sample have been filtered **to avoid sucking water through the vacuum, so pay attention to that!**

**10.**	Once the sample has finished filtering, close the filter column.

**11.**	Transfer the filter to the appropriate (labeled) aluminum weigh pan. 

**12.**	Rinse the filter column with DI water and start filtering another sample, or just rinse the column with DI water if you don’t have any more samples to filter. Rinse the filtrate flask when you are all done.

**13.**	**Measure the amount of water remaining in the sample.**

**14.** Place the samples in a drying oven at <40 degrees C for ~24 hrs.

**15.** After the sample is completely dried, weigh the filter. **Record the filter mass on the filtering log sheet.**
